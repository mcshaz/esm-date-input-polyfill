# esm-date-input-polyfill

Just include this simple script and IE, macOS Safari, and legacy browser versions will support `<input type="date">`, without any dependencies, not even jQuery!

Support dynamically created inputs, so can be used in single page applications.

Forked from [nodep-date-input-polyfill](https://github.com/brianblakely/esm-date-input-polyfill) which was in turn forked from [html5-simple-date-input-polyfill](https://github.com/liorwohl/html5-simple-date-input-polyfill). Continuing as a separate project.

## Demo

[Try it in IE, macOS Safari, and legacy browser versions.](https://mcshaz.github.io/esm-date-input-polyfill/)

## Install

### NPM

```bash
# npm
npm install --save esm-date-input-polyfill

#yarn
yarn add esm-date-input-polyfill
```

Add to your project:

* **Webpack / Rollup / Babel / ES:** 
```js
import { polyfillIfRequired } from 'esm-date-input-polyfill';
polyfillIfRequired({
    watchForInsert: true,
}).then((_polyfillWasInserted) =>
    // we can now safely access the polyfilled properties valueAsDate and valueAsNumber
    document.querySelector('input[type=date]').valueAsDate = new Date())
);
```

* **Script Tag:** Copy `esm-date-input-polyfill.js` from `node_modules/esm-date-input-polyfill/dist/iife` and include it anywhere in your HTML. This will use an Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) which creates the object `dateInputPolyfill` as a global property (i.e. on the `window object`).
```js
dateInputPolyfill.polyfillIfRequired()
```
or with options such as:
```js
dateInputPolyfill.polyfillIfRequired({forcePolyfill: true})
```
Will initiate the polyfill.

## Configuration

#### function returns
Returns a `promise` which is resolved:
- If the browser supports date inputs, the promise will resolve immediately (the `then` callback `success function` argument will have a value of `false`).
- If the browser _does not_ natively support date inputs _or_ the `forcePolyfill` option [see below] is `true`, the promise will return after the DOM content has been loaded and all date-input elements in the document (at that point in time) have been polyfilled.The `then` callback `success function` argument will have a value of `true`.

### Options may be provided to the polyfillIfRequired function:

#### watchForInsert
Type: `boolean` | Default: `false`

Set up a `MutationObserver` to look for dynamically inserted date-inputs. For performance reasons, this option should be false if the page does not dynamically insert DOM nodes. If your page heavily uses animations, it is possible this slows your page down.

Originally this script had only run on mousedown event (e.g. when entering the input for the first time), which is more performant, but results in no placeholder being added until after the user has clicked the mouse somewhere on the page. The old code is still commented out in addPickers.js if that better suits your needs.

#### forcePolyfill
Type: `boolean` | Default: `false`

Will apply the date-input polyfill _even if_ the browser natively supports date-input elements, **if** the input element or any ancestor of the input elment has a `data-force-date-input-polyfill` attribute. Forcing the polyfill _in a browser which natively supports date inputs_ will result in the `type` attribute of the date-input being chaged from `date` to `date-polyfill`.

#### yrsBack
Type: `number` | Default: `80`

How many years before (prior to) the current year the `year select` will display.

#### yrsFwd
Type: `number` | Default: `20`

How many years after (forward of) the current year the `year select` will display.

## Using in your project

### Webpack / Rollup / Babel / ES:
Using the module/nomodule approach. Have a look at the example in this repository:
 - Create an entry (input) [.js or .mjs or .ts] [file for browsers which support ECMAScript modules](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/examples/esm.module.js), which includes a polyfill for dynamic import in browsers which support modules but not dynamic import statements. 
 - Have a [seperate entry file for legacy browsers](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/examples/esm.nomodule.js).
 - Modern browsers will only download a tiny file to check for date-input support, and download the appropriate polyfill only if date inputs are not natively supported.
 - Older browsers will download the full executable. see the example directory and the [rollup config](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/rollup.config.js) within this repository. 
 - Check if the script has already been run in the [common file](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/examples/esm-page-script.js) that the 2 enty files point to (a problem with Safari 10 respecting `<script type="module" src="...">` but _not_ respecting `<script nomodule src="...">`).

```js
import { polyfillIfRequired } from 'polyfill-if-required.mjs';
if (window.__my_script_loaded) { // https://gist.github.com/samthor/64b114e4a4f539915a95b91ffd340acc
    throw new error("[my-script] has been executed twice - usually a Safari bug");
}
window.__my_script_loaded = true;
export function myScript() {
    polyfillIfRequired({watchForInsert: true}).then(function() {
```

### Script Tag:
Execute `dateInputPolyfill.polyfillIfRequired()` and if required with an option object with the properties described above. See the example of this workflow [here](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/docs/iife.html).


## Features
* **Easily Stylable:** [These are the default styles](https://github.com/mcshaz/esm-date-input-polyfill/blob/master/src/esm-date-input-polyfill.scss), which you may override with your own.

* **Polyfills `valueAsDate` and `valueAsNumber`:**
[Learn more about these properties.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement#property-valueasdate). They behave as getters and setters.

* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** `Esc` will hide the datepicker. `Up/Down` will increment/decrement the date by one day.

* **Localization:** As per native `<input type="date">` implementations, this uses the browser default locale settings.

## Usage Notes

* `getAttribute('value')` and `setAttribute('value', ...)` and the element's `.textValue` property will only reflect the field's (localised) text content. 

* In order to work with the field's underlying value, you must get/set its
`value`, `valueAsDate`, or `valueAsNumber` _property_, *not* its _attribute_.
The value attribute can, however, be safely set in yyyy-mm-dd format _before_
the polyfillIfRequired() method is executed.


* Per the native implementation, polyfilled date fields will only accept
values in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.

* When submitting an HTML form, the browser will submit the date field's `value`
*attribute* (i.e. its text content), not the normalized content of the field's
`value` *property*.

    If you don't want that, one potential workaround is to change
    the attribute upon form submission:
    ```js
    el.form.addEventListener('submit', (e)=> el.setAttribute('value', el.value));
    ```

### Local Development
Run `npm start` or, for Cloud9 IDE users: `npm run start-c9`

### Build
Run `npm run build`

### Features
Given the lifecycle of browsers which do not natively support date-inputs, there no plans to add the features below, however if this project were to have a roadmap:
- placeholder currently uses english characters e.g. `dd/mm/yyyy`. This should clearly be language specific.
- separate out language files and dynamically retrieve only the 1 language file required.
- have a cross inside the right of the input which deletes the selected date. At present to delete the date, the text within the input can be selected and deleted.

## Thanks
Some words of appreciation for those who have submitted tickets, pull requests,
and new localizations.  The library is more robust and helpful to everyone
because of those who choose to help out.
