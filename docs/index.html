      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/examples/src/iife.html">IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) example</a>. This is just dropping the script into an html file.
          This example includes the ability to see native datepickers side by side with the polyfill in browsers which support &lt;input type="date"&gt;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/examples/src/esm.html">ESM (ECMAScript modules) with dynamic loading</a>. This will require some kind of bundler (such as Webpack, Browserify, or as in this case Rollup).
          This ensures only a tiny script is loaded by modern browsers, while older browsers download the full polyfill.
